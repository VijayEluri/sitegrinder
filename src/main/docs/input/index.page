Stringtree Site Grinder is a tool for managing web sites. 
It aims to eliminate repetitive typing and copy/paste to let you focus on useful and attractive content.
</p>

<h2>Instant Tutorial</h2>

<p>First, lets create a very simple "hello, world" web site, just to demonstrate that Stringtree Site Grinder 
can process a simple page definition</p>
 
<ol>
	<li>Create a new directory for Stringtree Site Grinder tutorials, perhaps named <tt>tutorial</tt></li>
	<li>Create two directories in your tutorial folder named <tt>input</tt> and <tt>output</tt></li>
	<li>Create a file in your <tt>input</tt> directory named <tt>index.page</tt></li>
	<li>Add the following lines to the new <tt>index.page</tt> file: <pre class="example">
page.title=Index
	
&lt;h1&gt;Hello from Stringtree Site Grinder&lt;/h1&gt;</pre>

Note that there is a blank line between the page title definition and the HTML content of the page. 
This is important, as it allows the system to tell the difference between <i>header</i> lines (which do 
things such as define common values) and the <i>content</i> of a page</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, let's "grind" it using the command-line tool. This is not the only way to use Stringtree Site Grinder, 
but it is a simple way to start.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Open a command prompt in the tutorial directory you created above</li>
	<li>Copy the sitegrinder.jar file into your directory</li>
	<li>Enter <tt>java -jar sitegrinder.jar input output</tt><li>
</ol>

<p>A new file <tt>index.html</tt> will appear in the <tt>output</tt> directory. Open the file in a web browser 
to see your new web page with it's hello message.</p>
